# Simple-Assembler-for-Custom-Instruction-Set-Architecture
This project implements a simple assembler for a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The assembler reads assembly code, processes it in two passes, and outputs the corresponding binary machine code. It supports memory-reference instructions (MRI), register-reference instructions (RRI), and input-output instructions (IOI).
